Create a logic for learning session - 15 Cards a day?
For A1 user, start with the A1 cards

Users mark each card as "Mastered" or "Review Again" after viewing the answer.
After all daily cards are marked "Mastered," a quiz tests the user's knowledge of that day’s vocabulary.

Leaderboard displays todays quiz result
We should pull 5 new cards and 5 from any history randomly to show
Add one more card to make total cards 100 - that will take 20 days for a user to complete all the cards

Fix today's stats


*********************

I want to implement this into my LearningSession.

We should pull 5 new cards and 5 from any history randomly to show.
First we will show the user:
A flashcard that has front and back. Front is the baseForm field pulled from firestore database learningCards collection. 
Users mark each card as "Mastered" or "Review Again" after viewing the answer.
After all daily cards are marked "Mastered," a quiz tests the user's knowledge of that day’s vocabulary.
